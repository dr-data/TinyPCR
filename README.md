This ultra portable and compact thermocycler was designed with the goal to bring the cost down to affordable price for anyone who wants to do some Do-It-Your-Self biology with a DNA starter kit in his kitchen. Based on the amazing PicoPCR by Yanwo Guo that demonstrated that a thermocycler can be run from USB power by reducing the number of vials and shrinking down the heat-block, the PocketPCR is designed for efficient manufacturing even at low volume. The design is built on a single circuit board (PCB) with an AVR M0 32bit processor, an OLED display and a rotary encoder to set navigate the menus. All device can be operated stand alone and all parameters can be set without the need of a computer or smartphone.

## Specifications
Despite its small size, this TinyPCR is a full-fledged thermocycler with features like the large laboratory machines. Cycle times can be individually set and temperatures are controlled with a great accuracy. Fully compatible with standard plasticware and reagents.

## PID temperature control
Temperature range: Ambient to 99Â°C
Technology: Resistive Heating, assisted cooling
USB powered from any 2A power adapter or computer port
Sample Tubes: 5 x 0.2ml PCR tubes
Small size of 33mm x 105mm x 50mm
Weight: 50 grams
This TinyPCR machine does not have a heated lid and mineral oil is required to prevent sample evaporation. Mineral oil comes with machine.

## Efficiency:
Comparison of a commercial PCR machine (Thermo SPRT001) with the PocketPCR show similar results. The PocketPCR with its small thermal mass heat-block finished the 30 cycles for the bacterial 16s rDNA amplification faster than the commercial machine.
